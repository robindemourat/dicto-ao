00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,770
be offered no simply I had the honor to
welcome the United Nations is excellent

2
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,940
she better go Obama President of the
United States of America and invite him

3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:44,490
choice which the assembly

4
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:59,420
president general elegance ladies and
gentlemen suddenly years after the

5
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,980
founding of the United Nations is worth
reflecting on what together members of

6
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:18,000
this body have helped to achieve asherz
of the second world war having witnessed

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,210
the unthinkable power Atomic Age United
States has worked with many nations in

8
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:33,900
this assembly to prevent a third world
war by forging alliances with all that

9
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,200
resents by supporting the steady
emergence strong democracies accountable

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:50,250
to their people in power by building
international system that imposes costs

11
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,750
on those who choose conflict over
cooperation in order that recognizes the

12
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:09,679
dignity and equal work that is the work
of seven decades that is the ideal that

13
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,330
this body at its best his pursuit of
course there have been too many times

14
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:23,250
when collectively we have fallen short
of these ideals over seven decades

15
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,190
terrible complex claimed victory

16
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:38,410
but we have pressed forward slowly
steadily to make a system of

17
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:45,400
international rules and norms that are
bank better and stronger and more

18
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:53,990
consistent international order that is
unwritten underwritten unparalleled

19
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:01,350
advances in human liberty and prosperity
is this collective endeavor that's

20
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,690
brought about diplomatic cooperation
between the world's major powers but

21
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,440
restore global economy that has lifted
more than a billion people from poverty

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,790
it is these international principles
that help constrain major countries from

23
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:26,080
imposing our will on small and advance
the emergence of democracy and

24
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:38,250
development and individual liberty this
progress is real it can be documented in

25
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:48,000
life saved and agreements forged
diseases Concord mouse pad yet we come

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,320
together today knowing that the march of
human progress

27
00:03:51,320 --> 00:04:00,080
never travels in a straight line but I
work is far from complete that dangerous

28
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,989
currents risk calling us back into a
darker more disordered world today we

29
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,330
see the collapse of strongman and
fragile states creating conflict and

30
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:21,480
driving innocent men women and children
across borders on an epic scale networks

31
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,530
of terror stepped into the backyard

32
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,500
technologies that empower individuals
are now also exploited by those who

33
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:41,380
spread this information was surprised to
set for radicalize are you well we'll

34
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,169
capital flows of power growth in
investment but also increased risk of

35
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:57,139
contagion week and the bargaining power
of workers and accelerated how should we

36
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:03,480
respond to me stress

37
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,530
there are those who argue that the
ideals enshrined in the UN Charter

38
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,120
unachievable out of date

39
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:23,430
legacy postwar era that suited to are
all factors for a return to the rules

40
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:30,300
apply for most of human history and that
predate this institution leave the

41
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,680
powers of zero sum game that might makes
right but strong states must impose

42
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:45,700
their will on weaker ones the rights of
individuals no matter the time of rapid

43
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:56,190
change order must be imposed by force on
this basis we see some major powers

44
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:02,630
assert themselves in ways that
contravene international law provision

45
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,270
democratic principles of human rights
that are fundamental to this

46
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:14,260
institution's mission formation is
strictly controlled the space for civil

47
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,820
society restricted

48
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,770
we're told that such retrenchment is
require to beat back disorder that the

49
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:32,960
only way to stamp out parents or prevent
foreign meddling with this logic we

50
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,560
should support tyrants like which are
all US dropped barrel bombs to

51
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:48,880
masquerade as children because the
alternative is surely worse increasing

52
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,200
skepticism among international order can
also be found in the most advanced

53
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,690
democracies see greater polarization
more frequent gridlock movements on the

54
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,430
far right sometimes I left this job
stopping the trade that binds our fates

55
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:18,120
to other nations going for a building a
wall to keep out immigrants most

56
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,500
ominously we see the fears of ordinary
people being exploited for appeals to

57
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:32,260
sectarianism or tribalism or racism or
anti-semitism glorious past before the

58
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,040
body politic was infected by those who
look different or worship God

59
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,210
differently politics of us versus them

60
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:52,090
United States is not immune from this
economy is growing at our troops largely

61
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:59,360
returned from Iraq and Afghanistan we
see in our debates about america's role

62
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,970
in the world

63
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:13,900
notion of strength is defined by
opposition to the enemies received

64
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:21,919
adversaries a rising China a resurgent
russia revolutionary Tehran Iran Islam

65
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:32,830
that is incompatible with peace argument
made that only strengthened matters for

66
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:44,830
the United States bellicose words shows
a military force cooperation and

67
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,520
diplomacy will not work

68
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:59,240
as president United States mindful of
the dangers that we face across my desk

69
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:07,410
every morning I read the strongest
military the world has ever known and I

70
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,180
will never hesitate to protect my
country or allies unilaterally by force

71
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:21,940
when necessary but I stand before you
today believing in my court that we

72
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:30,980
nations of the world cannot return to
the old waves of conflict and course we

73
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:38,750
cannot look back we live in an
integrated world one in which we all

74
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:45,970
have a stake in each other's success we
cannot turn back those forces of

75
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,940
integration donation in this assembly
could insulate itself from the threat of

76
00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,370
terrorism or the risk of financial
contagion flow of migrants where the

77
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,250
danger warming planet

78
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:14,480
disorder we see is not driven solely by
competition between nations or any

79
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,760
single ideology we can all work together
more effectively we all suffer the

80
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:30,690
consequences that is true for the united
states as well no matter how powerful

81
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:42,130
army alter how strong are common we
understand the United States cannot

82
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:51,100
solve the world's problems alone in Iraq
United States learn the hard lesson that

83
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,840
even hundreds of thousands of brave
troops trillions of dollars from our

84
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,610
treasury cannot by itself

85
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,950
impose stability on a nice we work with
other nations under the Mental

86
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,070
international norms and principles and
all that offer legitimacy to our efforts

87
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:20,570
we will not succeed unless we work
together to defeat the ideas that drive

88
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,630
different communities in a country like
a rock into conflict any order that our

89
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,850
military's can impose will be temporary

90
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:41,759
justice force alone cannot impose order
international I believe to my core that

91
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:49,350
repression cannot force the social
cohesion for nations to succeed his real

92
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,529
last two decades proves that in today's
world dictatorships are unstable today

93
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:01,670
become the spark of revolution tomorrow
you can email your opponents but you can

94
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:08,139
imprison ideas can try to control access
to information but you cannot turn a

95
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:15,639
light into troop it's not a conspiracy
of us- backed and she always been

96
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,000
exposed corruption and raising
expectations of people around the globe

97
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,100
technology social media and the
irreducible desire of people everywhere

98
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:35,630
to make their own choices about how
their government did I believe that in

99
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,160
today's world the measure of strength is
no longer defined by the control of

100
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:47,339
territory lasting prosperity does not
come solely from the ability to access

101
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:56,180
and extract raw materials the strength
of Nations depends on the success of

102
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,639
their people their knowledge innovation
their imagination their creativity their

103
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,560
drive their opportunity and that in turn
depends on individual rights and good

104
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,640
governance personal security

105
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,500
internal repression and foreign
aggression both symptoms the failure to

106
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:28,230
provide this foundation politics of
solidarity that depend on demonizing of

107
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:36,090
the drawers on religious sectarianism
bernau tribalism or jingle in bad times

108
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:42,060
looked like strength in the moment but
over time its weakness will be exposed

109
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,690
and history tells us that the dark
forces unleashed by this type of

110
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,910
politics

111
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:55,920
surely makes all of us less secure our
way has been there before we get nothing

112
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,610
from going back

113
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:08,000
I believe that we must go forward in
pursuit of our ideals not abandon them

114
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,040
at this critical time we must give
expression to our best hopes not our

115
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,220
deepest fears this institution was
founded because men and women who came

116
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,470
before us had the foresight to know that
our nations are more secure when we

117
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,079
uphold basic laws and basic norms and
pursue a path of cooperation over

118
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:39,380
conflict and strong nations above all
responsibility to uphold this

119
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:51,920
international or office I made clear the
one of the principal achievements of

120
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,220
this body the nuclear non-proliferation
regime was endangered by Iran's

121
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,070
violation of the NPT basis the Security
Council tightened sanctions on the

122
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:14,910
Iranian government has joined us
together we show that laws and

123
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,050
agreements mean something but we also
understood that the goal of sanctions

124
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,399
was not simply to punish Iran our
objective was to test whether Iran could

125
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,110
change course acceptance rates while the
world to verify that its nuclear program

126
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,750
will be peace for two years

127
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:45,459
partners including Russian including
China stuck together and complex

128
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:53,040
negotiations result is a lasting
comprehensive deal that prevent Iran

129
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,760
from obtaining a nuclear weapon while
allowing it to access peaceful energy

130
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:03,579
and if this deal is fully implemented
the provision of nuclear weapons is

131
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,520
strengthened a potential war is a burden

132
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:18,860
is safe at is the strength of the
international system works the way it

133
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:25,440
should be

134
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:35,640
to international order our responses to
other challenges around the world

135
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:43,120
russia's annexation of crime and further
aggression in eastern Ukraine America's

136
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,740
economic interests in Ukraine we
recognize the deep and complex history

137
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,460
between Russia and Ukraine but we cannot
stand by when the sovereignty and

138
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,710
territorial integrity of a nation is
flagrantly violated that happens without

139
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:07,970
consequence in Ukraine it could happen
to any nation gathered here today that's

140
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,680
the basis of the sanctions and our
partners impose on russian it's not a

141
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:20,530
desire to return to a cold war in Russia
state-controlled media may describe

142
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:28,130
these events as an example of a
resurgent russia view shared by the way

143
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:34,180
number of urs politicians and
commentators who have always been deeply

144
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,600
skeptical of russia and seemed to be
commenced a new Cold War is in fact a

145
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,790
pumice

146
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,450
the results

147
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,320
Ukrainian people are more interested
than ever in line with Europe instead of

148
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,090
Russia sanctions have led to capital
flight

149
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:01,220
contracting economy falling and the
immigration of more educated russians

150
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:12,880
imagine if instead Russia had engaged in
true diplomacy and worked with Ukraine

151
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,130
and the international community to
ensure its interests were protected I

152
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,230
would be better for Ukraine but also
better for russia and better for the

153
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:32,350
world which is why we continue to press
for this crisis to be resolved a

154
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,940
sovereign and democratic ukraine to
determine its future and control its

155
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,710
territory now because we want to isolate
russia we don't but because we want a

156
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,789
strong russia that's invested in working
with us to strengthen the international

157
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:53,810
system

158
00:18:53,810 --> 00:19:00,400
similarly in the South China Sea United
States makes no claim on territory there

159
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,870
we don't adjudicate claims but like
every nation gathered here we have an

160
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:13,110
interest in upholding the basic
principles of freedom of navigation and

161
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,410
the free flow of commerce and in
resolving disputes through international

162
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:26,890
law but law force so we will defend
those principles while encouraging China

163
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:36,260
and other claimants to resolve their
differences peacefully

164
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:45,700
I say this recognizing the diplomacy is
heart that the outcomes are sometimes

165
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:54,240
unsatisfying that it's really
politically popular but I believe that

166
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,910
leaders on large nations in particular
have an obligation to take these risks

167
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:05,240
precisely because we are strong enough
to protect our interests if and when

168
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:15,790
diplomacy face I also believe it to move
forward in this know where we have to be

169
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:24,550
strong enough to acknowledge when what
you're doing is not work for fifty years

170
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:34,480
policy but failed to improve the lives
of the cuban people we change that we

171
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,310
continue our differences with the cuban
government will continue to stand up for

172
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,640
human rights but we address these issues
through diplomatic relations and

173
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,200
increase commerce people-to-people ties

174
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,690
these contacts progress I'm confident
that our congress will inevitably lift

175
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:07,890
the embargo that should not be in place
anymore

176
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:14,650
come overnight to cuba but I'm confident
that opened US version will support the

177
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:21,670
reforms better the wife the cuban people
deserve just as I believe that Cuba will

178
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:30,830
find its success if it pursues
cooperation with other nations if it's

179
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,750
in the interest of major powers to
uphold international standards it is

180
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,900
even more true for the rest of the
community of nations around the world

181
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:51,610
from Singapore to Columbia to Senegal
the facts show that nation's succeed

182
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,610
when they pursue an inclusive peace and
prosperity within the borders and work

183
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:06,170
cooperatively with countries beyond
their borders that path is now available

184
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:14,360
to a nation like run which continues to
deploy file a proxy statement for its

185
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,970
efforts may appear together on
leveraging disputes with neighbors but a

186
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,530
fuel sectarian conflict that endanger
the entire region and isolates derived

187
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:33,810
from the promise of trade and commerce
people have a proud history are filled

188
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,030
with extraordinary attention but
chanting death to America does not

189
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:48,260
create jobs more secure line choose a
different path that would be good for

190
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:56,010
the security of the region good for
Iranian people and good for the world

191
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,310
of course around the globe we will
continue to be confronted with nations

192
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:06,590
will reject these lessons of history

193
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:13,210
border disputes and sectarian warrants
read about aristide claims and

194
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:25,070
humanitarian disasters where order has
completely broken down we must but we

195
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:31,600
will be stronger when we act together in
such efforts United States will always

196
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,850
do our part to do so mindful about
lessons of the past I just the lessons

197
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,680
of Iraq but also the example of Libya
where we joined an international

198
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:51,220
coalition under a UN mandate to prevent
a slow even as we helped the Libyan

199
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,510
people bring an end to the right of a
tyrant or coalition could have and

200
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:02,790
should have done more to fill a vacuum
left behind

201
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:08,980
grateful to the united nations for its
efforts to forge a unity government will

202
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,240
help any legitimate Libyan government as
it works to bring the country together

203
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,790
but we also have to recognize that we
must work more effectively in the future

204
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:28,190
as an international community to build
capacity for states to stress before

205
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,280
they collapse

206
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,640
that's why we should celebrate the fact
that later today

207
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,730
United States will join in with more
than 50 countries to enlist new

208
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:45,690
capability infantry intelligence
helicopters hospitals and tens of

209
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:57,860
thousands of troops to strengthen United
Nations peacekeeping

210
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:04,890
can prevent mass killing and ensure that
peace agreements are more than words on

211
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:13,140
paper we have to do it together together
we must strengthen our collective

212
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:19,250
capacity to establish security worker
has broken down and to support those who

213
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,540
seek a just and lasting peace

214
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:30,179
know where is our commitment to
international order more tested that in

215
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:36,730
Syria

216
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,350
dictator slaughters tens of thousands of
his own people that is not just a matter

217
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,270
of one nation's internal affairs it
raised human suffering on an order of

218
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,740
magnitude that affects us all

219
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:59,030
likewise when a terrorist group beheads
captives slaughter the innocent and his

220
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:04,030
slaves women that single nation's
national security problem that is the

221
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:13,320
salt all our commander I said before and
I will repeat there's no room for

222
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,770
accommodating an apocalyptic cult like I
saw the United States makes no apology

223
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:24,730
for using our military is part of a
broad coalition to go after we do so

224
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,419
with a termination to ensure that there
will never be a safe haven for

225
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:34,370
terrorists who carry out these crimes
and we have demonstrated over more than

226
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,720
a decade of relentless pursuit of
al-qaida we will not be outlasted by

227
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,390
extremists but while military power is
necessary it is not sufficient to

228
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:54,360
resolve the situation in Syria lasting
stability can only take hold on the

229
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,179
people of Syria forge an agreement to
live together peacefully United States

230
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:06,270
is prepared to work with any nation
including Russia and Iran to resolve the

231
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:13,950
conflict but we must recognize that
there cannot be after so much bloodshed

232
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:22,509
so much carnage a return to the pre-war
status quo

233
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:33,099
let's remember how this started as I had
reacted to peaceful protests by

234
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:43,089
escalating repression and killing and in
turn created the environment for the

235
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:48,489
current strife and so i sat in his
allies can simply pacify the broad

236
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:52,719
majority of a population who've been
brutalized by chemical weapons and

237
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:59,819
indiscriminate bombing yes realism
dictates that compromise will be

238
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:05,479
required to end the fighting and
ultimately stamp out ice but realism

239
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:12,149
also requires a managed transition away
from us out and to a new leader and an

240
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,919
inclusive government that recognizes
there must be an end to this chaos and

241
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:26,409
that the Syrian people can begin to
rebuild we know that I saw which emerged

242
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:33,559
out of the chaos of Iraq and Syria
depends on perpetual war to serve but we

243
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,749
also know that they gain adherence
because of a poisonous ideology so part

244
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:46,239
of our job together is to work to reject
such extremism that infects too many of

245
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:51,869
our young people part of that effort
must be a continued rejection by Muslims

246
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:58,329
of those who distort Islam to preach
intolerance and promote violence must

247
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:02,799
also involve a rejection by non-muslims
of the ignorance that equates Islamic

248
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:11,450
terror

249
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:21,830
answers to Syria in there no simple
answers to the changes that are taking

250
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:31,789
place in much of the Middle East and
North Africa but so many families need

251
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:38,279
help right now they don't have time
that's why the United States is

252
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,740
increasing the number of refugees we
welcome within our borders

253
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,840
that's why we will continue to be the
largest donor of assistance to support

254
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,210
those refugees and today we are
launching new efforts to ensure that our

255
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,039
people and our businesses our
universities and our NGOs can help as

256
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:02,570
well as in the faces of suffering
families our nation of immigrants sees

257
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:09,389
ourselves of course in the old ways of
thinking the plight of the powerless the

258
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:14,000
plight of refugees the plight of the
marginalized did not matter they were on

259
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,399
the periphery of the world's concerns
today our concern for them is driven not

260
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,740
just by conscious but should also be
driven by self-interest for helping

261
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,799
people who've been pushed to the margins
of our world is not mere charity it is a

262
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:39,049
matter of collective security and the
purpose of this institution is not

263
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:42,510
merely to avoid conflict it is to
galvanize the collective action that

264
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:48,779
makes life better on this planet the
commitments we've made to the

265
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:54,870
Sustainable Development Goals speak to
the strip I believe that capitalism has

266
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,880
been the greater creator of wealth and
opportunity

267
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,340
the world has ever known

268
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,100
from big cities to rural villages around
the world we also know that prosperity

269
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:14,290
is still cruelly out of reach for too
many as it sold in US bob francis

270
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:22,700
reminds us we are stronger when we value
the least among these and see them as

271
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:32,170
equal in dignity to ourselves and our
sons and our daughters we can roll back

272
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:37,740
preventable disease and end the scourge
of hiv/aids we can stamp out pandemics

273
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,970
the recognizable borders at work may not
be on television right now but as we

274
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,800
demonstrated reversing the spread of
Ebola it can save more lives than

275
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:54,400
anything else we can do together we can
eradicate extreme poverty and erase

276
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,680
barriers to opportunity but this
requires a sustained commitment to our

277
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,100
people so farmers can feed more people
so entrepreneurs can start a business

278
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,270
without paying a bribe so young people
have the skills they need to succeed in

279
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:15,450
this modern knowledge-based economy we
can promote growth through trade that

280
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,010
meets a higher standard that's what
we're doing through the trans-pacific

281
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,000
partnership trade agreement that
encompasses nearly 40 percent of the

282
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,780
global economy an agreement that will
open markets while protecting the rights

283
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,050
of workers and protecting the
environment that enables development to

284
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:40,160
be sustained we can roll back the
pollution that we put in our skies and

285
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,650
help economies lift people out of
poverty without condemning our children

286
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:50,360
to the ravages of never warming climate
the same ingenuity that produced the

287
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,510
industrial age and the computer age
allows us to harness the potential of

288
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:02,130
clean energy no country can escape the
ravages of climate change there's no

289
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:08,820
stronger sign of leadership and putting
future generations first United States

290
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,590
will work with every nation that is
willing to do its part so that we can

291
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,080
come together in Paris

292
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:22,330
decisively confront this challenge and
finally

293
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:32,370
our vision for the future of
disassembling my belief

294
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:39,280
moving forward rather than back requires
us to defend the democratic principles

295
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:48,680
that allows societies to succeed let me
start from a simple premise catastrophes

296
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,780
like what we are seeing in Syria do not
take place in countries where there is

297
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,950
genuine democracy and respect for the
universal values this institution is

298
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:06,110
supposed to defend

299
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,609
I recognize the democracy is going to
take different forms in different parts

300
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:17,030
of the world the very idea of a people
governing themselves depends upon govern

301
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,760
government giving expression to their
unique culture their unique history

302
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:31,179
their unique experiences but some
universal truths are self-evident no

303
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:37,350
person wants to be imprisoned for
peaceful warship no woman should ever be

304
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:44,510
abused with impunity or girl barred from
going to school

305
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,889
the freedom to peacefully petition those
in power without fear of arbitrary lost

306
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:57,020
these are not ideas of one country or
one culture they are fundamental to

307
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:08,050
human progress there a cornerstone of
this institution I realize that in many

308
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,030
parts of the world there's a different
do you believe that strong leadership

309
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:19,220
must tolerate no dissent I hear not only
from America's adversaries but privately

310
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:26,610
least I also hear from some of reference
I disagree

311
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,190
I believe a government that suppresses
peaceful dissent is not showing strength

312
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:43,570
it is showing weakness and it's showing
fear history shows

313
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,510
history shows that regimes who fear
their own people will eventually crumble

314
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:56,720
but strong institutions built on the
consent of the government

315
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:05,160
endure long after any one individual is
gone that's why our strongest leaders

316
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:12,710
from George Washington to nelson mandela
elevated the importance of building

317
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:21,580
strong democratic institutions over a
thirst for perpetual power leaders who

318
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,060
amend constitutions to stay in office
only acknowledge that they failed to

319
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:33,420
build a successful country for their
people because none of us last forever

320
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:40,550
it tells us that power something they
cling to its own sake rather than for

321
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:47,500
the betterment of those they purport to
serve I understand democracy is

322
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:55,450
frustrating democracy in the United
States is certainly imperfect at times

323
00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:03,040
it can be dysfunction but democracy the
constant struggle to extend rights to

324
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,510
more of our people to give more people a
voice is what allowed us to become the

325
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:15,120
most powerful nation in the world

326
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,970
it's not simply a matter of principle
it's not an abstraction democracy

327
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:26,060
inclusive democracy makes country
stronger when opposition parties can

328
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:33,850
seek power peacefully through the ballot
a country draws upon new ideas what a

329
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:39,300
free media can inform the public
corruption and abuse are exposed and can

330
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:46,060
be rooted out when civil society thrives
communities can solve problems that

331
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:53,210
governments cannot necessarily solve
alone when immigrants are welcome

332
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,620
countries are more productive and more
vibrant when girls can go to school and

333
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,200
get a job and pursue unlimited
opportunity that's when a country

334
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:11,180
realize its full potential

335
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:18,150
that is what I believe is America's
greatest strength that everybody in

336
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:25,829
america agrees with me that's part of
democracy I believe that the fact that

337
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:29,920
you can walk the streets of this city
right now and past churches and

338
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,920
synagogues and temples and mosques where
people worship freely the fact that our

339
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,630
nation of immigrants mirrors the
diversity of world you can find

340
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,319
everybody from everywhere here in New
York City the fact that in this country

341
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:50,980
everybody can contribute everybody can
participate no matter who they are or

342
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:58,940
what they look like or who they love
that's what makes us strong and I

343
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,079
believe that what is true for america's
true for virtually all mature

344
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:09,160
democracies and that is no accident we
can be proud of our nation's without

345
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:16,410
defining ourselves in opposition to some
other group we're gonna be patriotic

346
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,460
without demonizing someone else we can
cherish our own identities our religion

347
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:29,280
or ethnicity are traditions without
putting others down our systems are

348
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:38,950
promised on the notion that absolute
power will corrupt people ordinary

349
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:45,710
people are fundamentally good value
family and friendship faith and the

350
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,210
dignity of hard work and that with
appropriate checks and balances

351
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:55,510
governments can reflect this goodness

352
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:02,780
I believe that the future we must seek
to go to believe in the dignity of every

353
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,490
individual to believe we can bridge our
differences and Jews cooperation or

354
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:19,599
conflict that is not weakness that is
strength

355
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:29,650
it is a practical interconnected world
understand this bank of the Liberian

356
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,789
doctor who went door-to-door to search
for ebola cases and to tell families

357
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:36,210
what to do if they show symptoms

358
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:43,309
think of the Iranian shopkeeper who said
after the nuclear deal God willing now

359
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,769
will be able to offer many more goods at
better prices

360
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:53,609
think of the Americans who lowered the
flag over our embassy in Havana in 1961

361
00:40:53,609 --> 00:41:06,210
the year I was born and return this
summer to raise that flag back up

362
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,210
one of these men set of the cuban people
we could do things for them and they

363
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:21,730
could do things for us we love for fifty
year is that fact

364
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:29,119
think of the family's leaving everything
they've known behind risking barren

365
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:39,030
deserts and stormy waters just to find
shelter just to save their children one

366
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:45,599
syrian refugee was greeted hampered with
warm greetings and shelter said we feel

367
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:55,760
there are still some people who love
other people the people are united

368
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,800
nations are not as different as they are
told

369
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:13,010
they can be made to fear they can be
taught to hate but they can also respond

370
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:21,330
hope history is littered with the
failure of false prophets and fallen

371
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:28,240
empires believe that might always makes
right and that will continue to be the

372
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,850
case you can count on that but we are
called upon to offer a different type of

373
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:41,140
leadership leadership strong enough to
recognize the nation's share common

374
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:48,430
interests and people share a common
humanity and yes there are certain ideas

375
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:55,430
and principles that our universe that's
what those who shaped the United Nations

376
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,210
seventy years ago understood I just
carry forward that faith in the future

377
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:05,880
for it is the only way we can ensure
that future will be brighter for my

378
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,990
children and for yours

379
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:34,940
thank you very much

380
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,670
the United States of America
