               "content": "A carbon market is typically a response by a government to control emissions of greenhouse gases and to lower those emissions over time by setting in place a cap that is allocated to every company that emits lots of CO2 in their factories. Typically it would cover the power production sector, cement, steel, refining, many of the things that we use in everyday life but that they emit CO2. The law allows them to emit a limited amount but also it recognizes that to reduce emissions, technologies have to be adopted and that money needs to be raised to pay for those technologies. Actually, the cost of doing carbon mitigation may be different in different factories or in different locations, member states in the European Union or different states in the United States of America. What this approach does is it allows the companies that are inside that system to trade what we call allowances which is essentially the right to emit one ton of CO2. If a company can adopt a technology to reduce emissions more than its quota, more than it needs to do, it can have extra allowances to sell to help pay for the equipment. There’s a whole market that’s growing up around this that involves the companies that are involved in reducing emissions but also the technology providers, the banks that help provide the investment, the law firms that help develop the contracts for all of these projects..",

               "content": "The industry and the power companies that are also part of this market want to have very clear goals. They want to know exactly what the political ambitions are because once they know what the political ambition is, then they can adjust their investment and their plans accordingly. The problem at the moment is nobody dares to say anything because everybody is very worried about their jobs. There are three fundamental issues at the moment in the carbon markets. The number one issue is the value for jobs. If you have a very high carbon price, that means you have higher electricity price for consumers and for industry, and you also have higher production costs for industry. When you’re producing, say, cement or steel or anything else, then if you have high carbon price, then the end products will be more. Some of the industry are saying that short term it will result in job losses.\nThe second issue is that when you are very ambitious about the environment, and hence you have very high carbon price, then (13:49) from the old industry will move into new industries, from old power into renewable, from inefficient production facilities into state of the art production facilities. That’s the second issue. This transfer of (14:03) from old to new is a very sensitive topic because the incumbent industries actually are very strong in lobbying in most cases. It’s not the case obviously for all cases but there’s a lot of lobbying going on by old industry of not to be too ambitious for the environment. The third issue is that this is great. This is our little cap for the EU, right? But we don’t live in the world of the EU. The boundaries don’t stop. We want to have cap but climate change and, more importantly, industry is global today. The third question that is on politicians’ agenda is: How do actually create ambitious environmental goals without risking that actually our factories are simply taken and moved somewhere else into China or other parts of Asia or basically from out of the EU, even to the East Ukraine or Russia, who don’t have the same ambitious goals? In terms of the emission trading system, the way this is solved is that companies that are very susceptible to competition from outside get a lot of free allowances where you could just import the end product from neighboring countries or from overseas. Those companies get free allowances. It’s called leakage. That’s one of the solutions for keeping high environmental goals and yet protecting interest..",
