So it is deeply, deeply territorial. I think it’s very human to think territorially. And if you look at the implementation of everything that is being decided in the framework of the United Nations, it all goes down to national legislation. You need to have a territory on which you can actually implement what you discussed internationally. So yes, it is territorial. But at the same time, people lose this sort of traditional relationship to the territory. They don’t grow up in one place and stay there all their lives anymore. They are highly mobile. They are requested to be highly mobile. They are living in the cyberspace. They have friends all over the world. They spend their holidays here and there. And they are, in a strange way, disconnected to their territory. So our relationship also to the territory, which is an integral part also of identity, is rapidly changing..",

               "content": "If you look at the world’s dry lands, basically the belt that goes from West Africa to East Africa up to Central Asia, there’s actually a substantial chunk of the world’s food production coming exactly from this area. So traditionally, it is absolutely possible to do agriculture there and the communities in the area all have a long tradition of conflict mediation and dealing with the scarcity of resources and very sophisticated pattern of herding the cattle here and doing agriculture here and having corridors for the cattle, all of that. And that worked over many centuries. Now, we have two factors that are changing that, or three. One is borders can actually buy colonialism, which are still there today, changing the logic and interrupting, for example, lines for cattle. The second thing, of course, is industrial scale agriculture that is quite often the attempt of producing something which is not adapted to the environment. A good example is cotton in Central Asia and the Aral Lake. That basically killed the Aral Lake. And then now, the third element of it is that climate change adds additional pressure to it. If you think of the Middle East and North Africa region, when we are ultimately managed, which I very much hope to stay under two degrees Centigrade, that won’t mean two degrees Centigrade for North Africa and the Middle East. That means four degrees because average global warming gives you only limited piece of information. It can mean that in the polar circle, you’re going up eight to nine degrees. In some areas of the world, it can be dramatic change. And especially this area, it’s exponentially affected by the changing climate. And that again is changing the blueprint of where people can live while actually there are people. Human settlement people choose the area where one can live as their residence. But now what do you do if you have people who are living somewhere and then they can’t live there anymore? Ultimately, the last means of adaptation is only migration. But in some of the lands of the area, I think with land restoration, you can still give people the perspective and the possibility to stay on their piece of land..",

               "content": "At the same time, we are not going to abolish nation states anytime soon. Just take the experience of the European Union. What a difficult and long process it is to go for further integration and people giving up a bit of their sovereignty. So they need a bit of both. They need to understand how the toolbox works and how national states work and how you get something to become a piece of legislation, and at the same time, I very much hope that they have in their minds the necessity of international cooperation and the sheer imperative of certain problems that simply cannot be solved on a national level. And how that is going together is, I think, the big challenge. There is a relationship between common good and poverty. The poorer you are, the more you depend on natural shared commodities. If you have clean water running from tap, you don’t need to drink the water out of the river. If you’re a slum dweller and you have no running water, you are drinking the water from the river, and if it’s infested and polluted, you’re going to become ill or even die. It’s the same thing with land. Fifty percent of people living in extreme poverty are actually living somewhere on the countryside. So they live directly from the land. What many people don’t understand is we have a soil, a land crisis which is maybe as big as the climate crisis. We are losing arable land the size of Switzerland every single year. It’s billions of tons of soil going, ultimately being washed out to the ocean. They pollute the oceans, and at the same time, it takes a very, very long time to grow soils. It takes a hundred years to grow 10 centimeters of topsoil. And then again, soil for us is, if you take the English word, it’s dirt. It’s worthless. It’s just what you have on your shoes and what needs to be cleaned. But it’s really the hand span of earth that is between the rock and what we see that keeps all of humanity living. And it’s only 1/32 part of the world’s surface is actually fit for agriculture. And on this little piece of land, we need to live and we are losing soil at a massive scale. So in a strange way, land represents the point of convergence for many of the things that the international community is looking into but not connecting to land. Climate change. Land loss actually results in CO2 emissions massively. Adaptation. If you want to work for water and food security, there is no better way than cultivating land and doing it right, fighting poverty, empowering communities, empowering women. All of that has to do with small farmers and land.  So in the climate negotiations, the big dialogue that we are seeing is actually not so much the question of “Should we do something against climate change or not?” I think everybody agrees that we need to do something against climate change and we need to act. The question is between development and fighting poverty in developed countries, where you have one part of the world that does brilliantly on the basis of fossil fuels and is very rich, and another part of the planet, actually the majority of the planet with an aspiration of becoming the middle class that we are and they see the way we became rich in their eyes based on fossil fuels, and they don’t want to have us dictating. Now that basically we know about the problem of climate change, you are not supposed to develop in the same way. So we desperately need something in which the fight against poverty connects with the fight against climate change. And land is something that can be restored, and that is exactly where I believe the true agendas can come together..",
