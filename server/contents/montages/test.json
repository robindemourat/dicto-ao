If you take the Pacific Islands, it really does matter where your ancestors are buried and where the graves of them are. And if they disappear, it’s a matter also of cultural identity. But it also has hard business interests. Fishery rights go as a circle around the island. I don’t know what it is, 300 miles or something. So this is worth money. So when the island is disappearing, do you still have the fishery rights? I think you need them because somewhere the money for resettlement needs to come from. But you spoke about a model. There is no model. This is a situation which is not foreseen in international law. For the Order of Malta, it was just an understanding at this point in time that they are so important that this continues. The Vatican is now condensed to a minuscule piece of land and still is a sovereign state. There is no solution to that foreseen. So climate change also forces us to think ahead of whether our traditional system really does justice to a country that loses its territory without any fault on the government’s side..",
