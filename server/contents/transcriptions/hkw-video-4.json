               "content": "I was trying to show the complex system science and say that’s not actually not how complex systems operate. You don’t get anything in between. You either stay below a tipping point, at which point the system may be pushed but if you don’t push it any further, it will eventually relax down to the state that you knew, or if you go across that point, feedback mechanisms kick in that push it all the way up to another state and it splits. The technical term is that it bifurcates. You simply don’t see a spectrum in between. You see relaxing back down to the state it was in or you see it going up. Think of it this way. Here’s a simple analogy. If I draw out on the river here, the spring, and I’m in a kayak, kayaking down the spring. And I tip it a bit. It comes back. It doesn’t stay tipped because it has a mechanism to resettle itself. If I tip it a bit more, it comes back. If I tip it just a little bit more, I go completely under. So that’s a system. That kayak and myself form a system that has two stable states --> operate paddling and upside down with my head in water nothing in between. Going halfway down and lying on the water is not a stable state. It will either pop up or it will go down. That’s typical of a complex system. So the point I was trying to make is the climate may very well act like that. Right now we’re tipping it. This two degree guard rail you hear people talking about that could be like your canoe going over but still it comes back. So we stop. We get two degrees by 2100. By 2300 it’s dropping back down toward the Holocene. I think if you go four degrees or more, you’re under- water. The canoe is not going to come back up. Where that point is between the canoe popping up and the canoe going underwater, I think, is somewhere between two and four but I don’t know where it is between that. That’s going to require some more work. And we may never know precisely.",

               "content": "A carbon market is typically a response by a government to control emissions of greenhouse gases and to lower those emissions over time by setting in place a cap that is allocated to every company that emits lots of CO2 in their factories. Typically it would cover the power production sector, cement, steel, refining, many of the things that we use in everyday life but that they emit CO2. The law allows them to emit a limited amount but also it recognizes that to reduce emissions, technologies have to be adopted and that money needs to be raised to pay for those technologies. Actually, the cost of doing carbon mitigation may be different in different factories or in different locations, member states in the European Union or different states in the United States of America. What this approach does is it allows the companies that are inside that system to trade what we call allowances which is essentially the right to emit one ton of CO2. If a company can adopt a technology to reduce emissions more than its quota, more than it needs to do, it can have extra allowances to sell to help pay for the equipment. There’s a whole market that’s growing up around this that involves the companies that are involved in reducing emissions but also the technology providers, the banks that help provide the investment, the law firms that help develop the contracts for all of these projects..",

Every year we know exactly what the emissions are. The penalties work. People do comply with the system. But there are problems. The symptom for the problem is that the price is very low. In the beginning of the system in 2005, the price is as high as 35 euros for one ton of CO2. Today the price is about 3.50 euros. It’s one-tenth of what it was. The reason for that is very simple. Economics is supply and demand. The supply is the cap. It’s the cap that the EU has decided to have as its emission goals. The demand is how much fossil fuel the emitters want to burn. Because the goals and the cap were established with the economic activity in 2007 before the crisis, the actual reduction targets and the goals were not particularly ambitious because we thought the economy was moving and it needed all this fossil fuel for the economy to thrive. Come 2008, 2009 and 2010, we are in an economic crisis. Industrial production fell but the cap is the same. When we look at basic economics, the supply is the same, the demand has fallen significantly, and the prices will fall significantly..",

They want to know exactly what the political ambitions are because once they know what the political ambition is, then they can adjust their investment and their plans accordingly. The problem at the moment is nobody dares to say anything because everybody is very worried about their jobs. There are three fundamental issues at the moment in the carbon markets. The number one issue is the value for jobs. If you have a very high carbon price, that means you have higher electricity price for consumers and for industry, and you also have higher production costs for industry. When you’re producing, say, cement or steel or anything else, then if you have high carbon price, then the end products will be more. Some of the industry are saying that short term it will result in job losses.\nThe second issue is that when you are very ambitious about the environment, and hence you have very high carbon price, then (13:49) from the old industry will move into new industries, from old power into renewable, from inefficient production facilities into state of the art production facilities. That’s the second issue. This transfer of (14:03) from old to new is a very sensitive topic because the incumbent industries actually are very strong in lobbying in most cases. It’s not the case obviously for all cases but there’s a lot of lobbying going on by old industry of not to be too ambitious for the environment. The third issue is that this is great. This is our little cap for the EU, right? But we don’t live in the world of the EU. The boundaries don’t stop. We want to have cap but climate change and, more importantly, industry is global today. The third question that is on politicians’ agenda is: How do actually create ambitious environmental goals without risking that actually our factories are simply taken and moved somewhere else into China or other parts of Asia or basically from out of the EU, even to the East Ukraine or Russia, who don’t have the same ambitious goals? In terms of the emission trading system, the way this is solved is that companies that are very susceptible to competition from outside get a lot of free allowances where you could just import the end product from neighboring countries or from overseas. Those companies get free allowances. It’s called leakage. That’s one of the solutions for keeping high environmental goals and yet protecting interest..",

It’s my pleasure to open this session, and I’m particularly happy to have Mr. Achim Steiner, the Executive Director of UNEP with us, also Mr. Jerry Lengoasa, WMO Deputy Secretary General; Mr. Florin Vladu from the UNFCCC Secretariat. And I’m very happy to welcome you all colleagues, distinguished delegates to this IPCC 46th session of the bureau meeting.\n\nI do believe this is an extremely important meeting because it’s taking place at a stage when we are reaching the finalization and completion of the fifth assessment report. We also know that this particular bureau meeting has been mandated by the panel to deal with a number of topics that clearly are going to be important and which would be fed into the next panel meeting at the end of this year. I believe that there are several subjects that we’re going to discuss today that have great significance for the IPCC communications strategy that certainly will come up for discussion. And this is something that the panel as a whole has mandated the bureau should deal with so that the executive committee of the IPCC can implement our communications strategy. I think communications are going to play an extremely important role, a growing role in the future. I still believe that the efforts and the resources that are being devoted to communications in the IPCC are not quite adequate. We have to find ways by which we can increase them. There are many other organizations that are in the business of getting out some form of assessment or the other. They clearly devote a much larger percentage of their resources to communications. I can give you the example of what happened with the millennium assessment report. And there are many other such efforts that I could also quote for your reference.",

Florin, to my right, is representing the process within which governments are negotiating that. We in the WMO and in UNEP, I think, represent within the United Nations system two very important platforms on which the continuous assessment not only of the emerging science but also of the policy responses, and not only in an idealized state but in the context of the real world, of the geopolitical reality, of the geo-economic realities, and also of the legacy realities which continue to hamper our negotiations internationally, need to be brought forward.",

               "content": "So the structure of the parallel computer is basically not much different to the structure of the regular computer except that we have thousand of components which are identical. So you have a processor, you have a main memory, then of course we also have disks. In the case of the cassette, the structure of the processor is that we have more than 8,000 so called processor cores, 8,000 acting components in the end. Where you and your computer have one or two and the biggest computer at the moment already have more than 1,000,000 processor cores and by the end of the decade we expect to see computers with this so called ex-flops performance. Which will have in the range of 1 billion of processing components. When it comes to the programs, the procedures are as it follows, you have a program that works on a set of data and does some computation. For example if you look at the climate simulation, you usually have to globe, you make a grip around the globe that has several levels and that gives you several tens of thousands, a hundred of thousands of points. And for you to get points, you compute what's going on there climate wise. Now when you bring this on a regular computer, then you have one processor to earn the computer for all the points. When you bring it on a parallel computer, what you do is, that you subdivide this whole amount, this whole set of points that you have on your grid then subdivide it for the individual processors. So, imagine that you have, for example, 1 million points in your environment there as a globe, and you have 1 thousand processors, then this means that each processor usually gets in a range of 1 thousand of these points and of course you have one processor computing this part of the globe and the other one computing that part. So, these parts, there will be parts which are neighboring and when you compute the 1 thousand points, there will always be points directly at the boundary of the region that belongs to that individual processor. That means for the boundary points, it will be necessary that in order to compute the new value, this is a step wise discreet time step simulation, what we do for a computation of a new value of an individual point. You have to see what the points of the neighbors are. Sometimes, one of the neighbor or several neighbors will not be in the region that you handle but it will be in a neighboring region. So this processor has to ask its neighboring processor to send him the value of these individual points. Basically that means that this takes time to do that. You're in this time, there's no computation going on that its communication. And the ratio between computation and communication defines the efficiency of your whole program. So it would be that best to have computation only and no communication at all. In really for this type of application, this is not possible. And when it comes to using ever more powerful computers, we are facing the problem that the computing elements get more and more but the grid size of your globe might stay more else constant for a while at least. So for example if you have the one million points of the one thousand processors, they have one thousand points per processor, that's easy. That's a lot of computation that you do and some communication. But if you have a bigger computer with one hundred thousand processing elements, one hundred thousand cores, then you have only 10 points per core.  Which means that the amount of computation that you have to do is very, very small but the communication that you have to do in order to get this job done is big. Your foremost each point you have to ask your neighboring processors, \"Hey, what's the value of your points?\" And that means computation drops to zero, communication is extremely high. This is just like in a badly organized bureaucracy, I would say. And that means the overall efficiency is low. You invest more, more money. You have more; more processing elements but the computation time, the completion time of your program will not go down anymore. So it will not speed up anymore. (07:35.2) at some point in time it reaches the limit where further paralyzation would not bring anymore benefit.",

The problems are that you have their several qualities that you have to consider. One is the quality of the application, where you say this application can be easily parallelized and as a consequence we can use a really big computer efficiently with that type of application. But the second course is the question, how scientifically important is that at all. And so we are in discussion with our users about the quality of the code and the quality of the science and somehow have to find the trail off and bring that to the machine because as the government spends so much money for such a big machine, it's obvious that we want to have optimally adapted codes on that machine. At best just these codes only in reality that the code does not work but also there must be a scientifically mean for that. And sometimes the scientifically meaning for ones are the ones which are not easy to be parallelized, we these examples. So there's always a trade off between what runs best on the machine, what brings the best effort for the science and for me as a computer scientist I cannot make that decision on my own so there's a whole committee working together with the DKRZ committee which takes care of decision making. They are all climate scientist and they take care of decision making who is allowed to take care which share of the machine for which amount of time. Usually we have 60 million core hours which means, hours on such a processing element per year available. So it's eight thousand and something cores multiplied by the number of hours per year, obviously. And from the 60 million, you make a division and say, \"Ok, we have a project which is important for IPCC\" for example, so they get a share of 10% of the overall capacity that we have per year..",
