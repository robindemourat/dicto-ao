You also know that the longer we leave decisive action, the more of the risk we run of unavoidable feedbacks in the climate system. It seems as if each incremental rise in greenhouse gas laws closes the door of another possible and better future for ourselves and for our descendants. Long ago, I realized that we are now facing a crisis that will be the defining moment for humanity. Why we have not responded with any urgency in the face of such visible warnings, and instead of cutting emissions have actually increased them each year, is utterly incomprehensible to many informed people. I fear that our failure to respond will hold future generations. At the moment, our rate of consumption of the planet’s natural resources, our seeming inability to alter our model’s economic growth, and our determination to more or less carry on as usual seems set to ensure that we will knowingly destroy their tomorrows, all for the short term gains of our today. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is an act of betrayal. It is also, of course, a huge risk. Think for a moment of the impact of climate change, not in scientific terms but as a doctor would view the problem. Whereas in science a hypothesis is tested until absolute proof is secured, in medicine there is no time to be absolutely certain. If a child is presented to a doctor with a fever, the doctor cannot wait until results of tests come back from the lab. The doctor must act on what evidence is already there. There is an urgency and it depends upon the risk involved. And given that this is the greatest risk we have ever faced, surely as the doctor we can’t wait to act. The symptoms are very clear. The models have become ever more precise. If we see the planet as our patient, the risk of delay is so enormous we cannot wait until we’re absolutely sure the patient is dying. That is a monumental risk no doctor would ever take.\n",

From what I have seen so far, if there is a determined collaborative attempt, a new platform for action could be established by 2015, it will not come without effort. But the stakes could not be much higher, nor the time for effective action more slight..",

Then they have two intermediate. And then they have the one and only path that would keep the world from increasing the temperature to above two degrees over pre-industrial levels. And the governments have already decided that they will not allow a temperature increase that would go above two degrees. In fact, they have committed themselves to keep it below two degrees Celsius..",

It means if you just look at the graph, it means that we would have to reach global emissions peaking. That means the maximum amount of emissions over the next six to ten years that we would then have to decrease sharply and get to carbon neutrality in the second half of the century, which means we would have to get to the point where we are absorbing as many emissions as we are emitting. And it is that balance between the two capacities of the planet that would then define carbon neutrality. That is the goal toward which we have to work..",

And they have reached a certain plateau, if you will, in their economic growth. That is remarkably different to the reality in developing countries because developing countries, that is where we’re getting all the new population. That is where we’re getting the young population coming on board. That is where we’re going to get the emissions because that is the new population and because developing countries are still on their upward growth curve on economic development.  So there is a very, very different reality in industrialized countries and in developing countries, and that is exactly why the convention is so, so clear that industrialized countries must support the future economic growth of developing countries so that developing countries can continue their economic growth, bring their population and all of their new population that is coming to join us on this planet, bring them out of poverty, provide them with the wellbeing that they need and that they deserve, but without having the carbon footprint that was attended to the economic wellbeing that the industrialized countries have had..",

And I think that earlier on, and maybe even today, some people think that when we talk about the earth system, we’re only talking about the natural system, the biology, the chemistry, the physics, the geology going on, and that we’re not talking about really the changes being brought on by humans or the effect of that in the whole multiple dimensions of society that are really involved in the planet that we live on. So maybe in some ways, the term earth system has constrained some people’s thoughts, first of all, to the biogeophysical system and then maybe also to being outside of it instead of a part of it. I think one of the things that the anthropocene as a word and as a concept does is it doesn’t constrain us maybe mentally quite so much of thinking about the planet per se as a biogeophsyical system, but really brings very much center stage people in that. So I think the anthropocene has a very big role to play in moving beyond that idea of it’s the planet and then there’s us to thinking about it as we really are a system, the anthropocene system. And if we could come up with a word maybe that would incorporate anthro for humans and the planet would be great, too, so that we really bring together those two concepts as opposed to the earth system, humans, but bring it together into one word..",

But the concept of the earth system goes way back, way before IGBP, and it was a developing concept of understanding the earth. And maybe it even started to come about because of the satellites and because of the exploration of space, looking back on the earth as the blue planet and as a planet itself that looked like it had clouds and weather moving around, etc..",

One is you read the literature and you read the scientific literature that isn’t at the scale that you maybe are working at. A lot of ways that we scale up or that people look at things at larger scales is by using models. So that’s one way to do it, to look at what those models might be saying. The other thing, though, is it’s equally important that people who are developing models are looking at the data, too, which is more local, which is more regional, and seeing if in fact they’re correctly putting those processes into their model as well. So I guess you also have to say it goes both ways. When you’re studying things at a large scale, you probably should go down and down going up, working back and forth both through literature and discussions. I mean a lot of it also is through talking with people at workshops, at conferences, and putting it in perspective that way as well..",

And when you say cybernetics, the other thing that comes to my mind is network theory. It’s also something that has been emerging and it used to be kind of outside the mainstream because it was too complex for people to kind of grasp and understand. And now it’s much more involved in understanding complex processes. I think that there are many things that come into play. Maybe one word latches on for a time. Like I said, the anthropocene is sort of the word of the day, the concept of the day. But 50 years or 100 years from now, who knows what the concept would be? Or even a few decades from now. I think anthropocene will be around for a while in terms of a term that’s used and help people to think of many dimensions. I think it’s a very useful concept..",

And I think that this historical lesson needs to be kept in mind that if China and India, at a stage of their development, when they had less economic and strategic space to maneuver on a treaty of lessened import done that heals in; that we can be quite sure that they would dig that faith heals in even more strongly with the state of climate change in the present day age. So the key is fairness; we can debate what fairness is. We cannot ignore it..",

I do not think that it’s feasible or appropriate for the international system to directly seek, to regulate or make policies for the internal constituents of countries.
