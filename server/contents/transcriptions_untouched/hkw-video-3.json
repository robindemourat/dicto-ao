Then they have two intermediate. And then they have the one and only path that would keep the world from increasing the temperature to above two degrees over pre-industrial levels. And the governments have already decided that they will not allow a temperature increase that would go above two degrees.

But it is also a well-known fact that in most industrialized countries, the greenhouse gas emissions curve is coming down because they have invested for a longer period of time in energy efficiency and in renewable energy. And they have reached a certain plateau, if you will, in their economic growth. That is remarkably different to the reality in developing countries because developing countries, that is where we’re getting all the new population. That is where we’re getting the young population coming on board. That is where we’re going to get the emissions because that is the new population and because developing countries are still on their upward growth curve on economic development.  So there is a very, very different reality in industrialized countries and in developing countries, and that is exactly why the convention is so, so clear that industrialized countries must support the future economic growth of developing countries so that developing countries can continue their economic growth, bring their population and all of their new population that is coming to join us on this planet, bring them out of poverty, provide them with the wellbeing that they need and that they deserve, but without having the carbon footprint that was attended to the economic wellbeing that the industrialized countries have had.."

And I think the anthropocene is about the earth system. And when I say the earth system, I don’t just mean the biogeophysical components. Of course it’s the human dimensions of it as well. It’s not only the effect that humans are having on the system but then how the changes in the system are affecting humans and how the whole societal structure, the whole political structure, the infrastructure as well, the international dimensions of agreements are affecting the direction that the earth’s whole system is going right now.."

And I think that earlier on, and maybe even today, some people think that when we talk about the earth system, we’re only talking about the natural system, the biology, the chemistry, the physics, the geology going on, and that we’re not talking about really the changes being brought on by humans or the effect of that in the whole multiple dimensions of society that are really involved in the planet that we live on. So maybe in some ways, the term earth system has constrained some people’s thoughts, first of all, to the biogeophysical system and then maybe also to being outside of it instead of a part of it. I think one of the things that the anthropocene as a word and as a concept does is it doesn’t constrain us maybe mentally quite so much of thinking about the planet per se as a biogeophsyical system, but really brings very much center stage people in that. So I think the anthropocene has a very big role to play in moving beyond that idea of it’s the planet and then there’s us to thinking about it as we really are a system, the anthropocene system. And if we could come up with a word maybe that would incorporate anthro for humans and the planet would be great, too, so that we really bring together those two concepts as opposed to the earth system, humans, but bring it together into one word.."

Personally, I think we’re just talking about a very small slice of time right now that at some point, again we’ll be looking out more outward beyond our own planet.."

And right in the original documents, it was that IGBP should be looking at the earth system and the natural processes in the earth system and the changes going on because of human pressures on the earth system. But the concept of the earth system goes way back, way before IGBP, and it was a developing concept of understanding the earth. And maybe it even started to come about because of the satellites and because of the exploration of space, looking back on the earth as the blue planet and as a planet itself that looked like it had clouds and weather moving around, etc.."

One is you read the literature and you read the scientific literature that isn’t at the scale that you maybe are working at. A lot of ways that we scale up or that people look at things at larger scales is by using models. So that’s one way to do it, to look at what those models might be saying. The other thing, though, is it’s equally important that people who are developing models are looking at the data, too, which is more local, which is more regional, and seeing if in fact they’re correctly putting those processes into their model as well. So I guess you also have to say it goes both ways. When you’re studying things at a large scale, you probably should go down and down going up, working back and forth both through literature and discussions. I mean a lot of it also is through talking with people at workshops, at conferences, and putting it in perspective that way as well.."

It’s also something that has been emerging and it used to be kind of outside the mainstream because it was too complex for people to kind of grasp and understand. And now it’s much more involved in understanding complex processes. I think that there are many things that come into play. Maybe one word latches on for a time. Like I said, the anthropocene is sort of the word of the day, the concept of the day. But 50 years or 100 years from now, who knows what the concept would be? Or even a few decades from now. I think anthropocene will be around for a while in terms of a term that’s used and help people to think of many dimensions. I think it’s a very useful concept.."
