    Dicto is a tool aimed at improving the usage of interviews or conferences footages in journalistic and academic contexts.
</p>

<p>

  It is aimed at supporting three types of activities :
  <ul>
    <li>Interview transcription/subtitling and timecodes refinement through a unique visual and keyboard-friendly interface.</li>
    <li>Interview coding and tagging, and export in table and text format for further analysis.</li>
    <li>Interviews reading/watching, with the possibility of defining "montages" inside a media piece, that is a subset of relevant moments and share them as reworked/remixed pieces of media.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Roadmap for further development :
  <ul>
    <li>Integration of youtube and soundrop as possible media inputs</li>
    <li>Support for .txt files and fuzzy recognition of non-orthodox transcription's timecoding and formatting</li>
  </ul>
</p>
